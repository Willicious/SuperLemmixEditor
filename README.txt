SuperLemmix Editor by William James.

Based on NeoLemmix Editor by Stephan Neupert and Namida Verasche.

This is an application to create new levels for SuperLemmix and NeoLemmix or modify old ones.
Levels must be in .nxlv format and the Editor should be present in a Super/NeoLemmix
installation folder with "styles", "sketches" and "levels" folder present.

Compile information for the Editor:
- Build "NLEditor.sln" (e.g. with Visual Studio 2022 or newer)
- The editor requires C# 7.0 (or newer)
- There are no dependencies on external libraries

Any bugs, feature requests and support issues are currently handled via the Lemmings Forums at
  
  www.lemmingsforums.net

Visit the SuperLemmix board there for more information. My nickname there is WillLem.
